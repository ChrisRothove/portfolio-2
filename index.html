            I'm Chris, a software engineer living in Kansas City Missouri. I consider
            myself a student of many different disciplines, and this makes
            me uniquely understanding of various endeavors and walks of life. It
            sounds like a fancy way of saying I'm a jack of all trades, and
            it is. But my focus is, and always will be, trying
            to reach people with stories that unite us as human beings.

          <h2>This is My Story</h2>
          <p>
            I came from an art background. The biggest thing I learned from the
            Kansas City Art Institute was that I didn't want a career in art. I
            have always enjoyed coding with HTML and CSS recreationally, and
            joined Thinkful to refine those skills into a new, more
            fulfilling career.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm excited to work with other developers on complex projects, and
            hope to design apps and websites which will reach people
            in new and interesting ways. I love to tell stories, and I want the
            things I work on to become a part of the stories of other people.
          </p>

          <p>
            When not coding I like to play and design videogames, play Dungeons
            and Dragons with my friends and play collectible card games.

          <h3>Mirage Masters</h3>
          <p>
            Mirage Masters is a personal project for a card game I'm working on
            for my online friends. It has a small audience and is not meant to
            be a profitable endeavor, but it is a fun way to keep the things I
            am learning relevant to me and impress my friends. One day soon I 
            would like it to be able to function as a manual for the card game. 
            In time I'd like to add a card game look-up, and a way to simulate 
            card pulls from packs. Eventually I'll have a small database of 
            cards to pull from.
