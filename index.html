            I'm Chris, a software engineer in Kansas City Missouri. I consider
            myself to be a student of many different disciplines, and this makes
            me uniquely understanding of various endeavors and walks of life. It
            sounds like a fancy way of saying I'm a jack of all trades, and
            that's not inaccurate. But my focus is, and always will be, trying
            to reach people with stories that unite us as human beings.

          <h2>This is My Story</h2>
          <p>
            I came from an art background. The biggest thing I learned from the
            Kansas City Art Institute was that I didn't want a career in art. I
            have always enjoyed coding with HTML and CSS recreationally, and
            joined Thinkful in order to refine those skills into a new, more
            fulfilling career.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm excited to work with other developers on complex projects and
            hope to work on and design apps and websites which will reach people
            in new and unique ways. I love to tell stories, and I want the
            things I work on to become a part of the stories of other people.
          </p>

          <p>
            When not coding I like to play and design videogames, play Dungeons
            and Dragons with my friends and play collectable card games.

          <h3>Mirage Masters</h3>
          <p>
            Mirage Masters is a personal project for a card game I'm working on
            for my friends online. It has a small audience and is not meant to
            be a profitable endeavor, but it is a fun way to keep the things I
            am learning relevant to me and impress my friends. This is a work in
            progress at the moment, but on day soon I would like it to be able
            to function as a manual for the card game, a card game look-up, and
            a way to simulate card pulls from packs. Eventually I'll have a
            small database of cards to pull from.
          </p>
          <p>Uses event listeners, sticky header, and hide navigation.</p>
          <p><em>This project is a work in progress</em></p>
