# My Portfolio

_Created during the Thinkful course_

This is the bones of a professional portfolio. Nice and basic. Would like to add
some things to it.

- more projects as I progress and complete them
- some kind of interactive component - like a simple game or interface
  - something entertaining but not too distracting
- potentially loop in my game/art work as well.
- A blog with posts updated weekly
  - topics separated among various focuses
  - use VSC to upload posts
- Maybe some kind of webcomic? idk I like those

### Current sections

- Intro
- about
  - consider combining intro and about in some way in the future
- contact
  - this email system is small and temporary - find different solution
- Projects
  - this version of Mirage Masters is out of date - update when ready to progress
    with react version
