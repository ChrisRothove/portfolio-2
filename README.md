## To Do:

- create video demos of projects as gifs
- some kind of interactive component - like a simple game or interface
  - something entertaining but not too distracting
- potentially include my game/art work as well.
- A blog with posts updated weekly
  - topics separated among various focuses
  - use VSC to upload posts
- Potentially a webcomic or other recurring artistic focus.
