# My Portfolio

_Created during the Thinkful course_

## Features

- Site is responsive and displays well on mobile and desktop.
- Site provides a functioning email form.

## To Do:

- The email system is small and temporary - find different solution
- Might want to create video demos of projects as gifs
- I would like some kind of interactive component - like a simple game or interface
  - something entertaining but not too distracting
- I will potentially include my game/art work as well.
- I want a blog section with posts updated weekly
  - topics separated among various focuses
  - use VSC to upload posts
